### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Ham, to outmaneuver Grier, must forge an alliance with a former rival he once ruined, exploring the bitter taste of necessary compromise.
- Draft the internal memo from Alastair Grier to the board, framing Ham's meticulousness as a dangerous liability to shareholder value, using modern financial jargon as a weapon.
- Compose Mhairi's private journal entry after the events of Chapter 1, revealing her own fears for Ham and the company, and perhaps a long-hidden personal loyalty.
- Imagine a flashback chapter to a young Ham MacTavish in the 1980s, using the same ruthless, knowledge-first tactics to secure his first major oil concession, drawing a parallel to his present crisis.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Narrative vs. Geology' dashboard that visualizes the conflict: one side tracks board sentiment, media headlines, and stock price (Narrative), the other tracks real drilling data, safety metrics, and core sample accuracy (Geology).
- Design a 'Power Probe' simulation where the user plays as Ham, receiving increasingly ambiguous reports from subordinates. Each decision to investigate or ignore drains a 'Trust/Time' resource, modeling the erosion of a leader's position.
